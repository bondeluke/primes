# Techniques
One of the quickest and most well-known strategies for finding prime numbers is the [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes). I take this basic concept, and apply sieve segmentation, [wheel factorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel_factorization), and parallelization on top if it.

## Parallelization
```rust
fn extend_in_parallel(&mut self) {
    const THREAD_COUNT: usize = 128;
    (0..THREAD_COUNT)
        .map(|i| {
            let segment = self.segment;
            let sieve = self.sieve.clone();
            let wheel = Arc::clone(&self.wheel);
            let primes = Arc::clone(&self.arc_primes);
            let next_spoke = Arc::clone(&self.next_spoke);
            thread::spawn(move || {
                PrimeIterator::extend(segment + i, sieve, wheel, primes, next_spoke)
            })
        })
        .collect::<Vec<JoinHandle<Vec<usize>>>>()
        .into_iter()
        .for_each(|handle| {
            self.primes.extend(handle.join().unwrap())
        });

    self.segment += THREAD_COUNT;
}
```
